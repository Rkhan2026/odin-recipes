    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, star anise and cumin seeds 
            into a fine powder. Finely chop mint and coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Add dry spice mix, chopped mint and coriander leaves and other marinade ingredients in a 
            mixing bowl and combine all of them. Add the chicken and coat it well. Use a plastic wrap 
            to cover the bowl and let the marinated chicken sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Wash the rice thoroughly. Take a saucepan and add water and rice in it. Once it boils, add 2 bay leaves and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and let it simmer until rice is partially cooked and is firm. This might take about 5 minutes. 
            Once done, drain the rice. Add saffron to a bowl of milk, stir and keep it aside.</li>
        <li>Add ghee to a large pot with a tight-fitting lid or a pressure cooker, heat it over medium-high flame. Stir in onions until golden brown for about 15 minutes. Drain them on a paper towel. Switch the flame to low and add bay leaves, chillies, and stir for about 1-2 minutes. Remove a tbsp of ghee from the pot and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken along with the marinade into the pot and cook for 2 minutes per side until it’s no longer pink. Spread the drained rice on top, sprinkle fried onions and drizzle ghee with saffron milk on top. Cook for 8-10 minutes over a high flame covered with a lid. Then reduce the flame to low and continue cooking for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the flame and let it stand covered for about 15 minutes. Garnish with mint and coriander leaves on top. Serve hot with raita or green salad.</li>
